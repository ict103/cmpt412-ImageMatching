Download the Matlab file and all images files (located in the
zip folder). Then simply run the Matlab code in Matlab.

To test each image, uncomment only one image at a time.

The chosen image will be tested on the collage image (which 
consists of all the images combined together into a single
collage image) and the top 3 matches will be displayed. 

The best match is around a green box, the second best match is 
around a yellow box, and the third best match is around a blue
box.
